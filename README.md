# DL_final_project
This is the final project for the Deep Learning course (CPSC 552).

To run the model, simply execute the following command:
<pre> python JCVAE_train.py </pre>

The training and test dataset is stored in **wfn_merged.h5**, which is approximately 45 GB in size. Due to its large size, it is available upon request.
